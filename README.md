### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

Alex aka fifty(squared) - a PT, a hacker, a metastabilian.

- ğŸ¤¯ Fun fact: a Metastabilian is someone who explores sixths senses of their selves, recongnising complementary contraries. In other words, they learn to recognise where delineations and borders percieved by most are in fact - illusions born out of nature of how mind and language manifest.
