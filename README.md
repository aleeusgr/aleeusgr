### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I am Alex. A hacker, a PT, a social entrepreneur.

- ğŸ’» Started coding with BASIC and Pascal, started hacking on eeePC701 running Debian.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Formal Systems, nature of Conflict and Violence, and their connection to Governance.
- ğŸ¤¯ Fun fact: some say the Noosphere is driven by the discrepancies between shared narratives of concepts and personal interpretations of these narratives.
