### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

Alex aka fifty(squared) - a PT, a reformed hacker, a metastabilian.

- ğŸ’» Tasted PC at 10, still remember the music of dial-up, hacked a distributed network in 2007; 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Institutions and their role in Violence and Conflict. 
- ğŸ¤¯ Fun fact: a Metastabilian is someone who explores sixths senses of their selves, recongnising complementary contraries. In other words, they learn to recognise where delineations and borders percieved by most are in fact - illusions born out of nature of how mind and language manifest.
